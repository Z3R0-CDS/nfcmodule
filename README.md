# NFCMODULE
Python module for NFC chip / Card<br>

## Ideas
    Console usage (With argument parsing)
    Add optional logger for file output

    While coding this software I only used the following Scanner, OS and python Version.
    I do not gurantee that code works as intended if you change any parameter

    Tested Scanner: ACR1252
    Tested OS     : Windows 10
    Python        : 3.7
